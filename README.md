This project aims to help me learn C++ and develop open-source projects.

### Current abilities
- Make moves off of user input
- Move pieces according to the rules of chess
- Can host chess games on the console

### Goals:
- (Drastically) Improve ai performance
- Regulate it to the UCI standards

### How to use:
1. Download the zip file
2. Compile it using any C++ compiler (You may need to download and include microbench by cameron314)
3. Run the executable created from the compiler
4. You can play moves with the makemove command, undo them with the undomove command, display the board with "d", and generate a move with go

Thanks to cameron314 for his benchmarking tool, you can download it [here](https://github.com/cameron314/microbench).
